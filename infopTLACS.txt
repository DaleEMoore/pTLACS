Overview






TODO
Solve the exercises in the Think Python book.

Change my exercise4.py turtle graphics code to accomidate my 2 monitor system. Right now the turtle canvas spans the two
monitors and the graphic is drawn in the middle between the two monitors so it's difficult to see. I want to change the
canvas to fit into one monitor.
    draw1.py - combines tkinter canvas and turtle and it's position well.
    canvas or screen (Canvas, ScrolledCanvas or TurtleScreen) from https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html.
